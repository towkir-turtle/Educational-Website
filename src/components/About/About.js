        <h2>Welcome to edureka's curriculum.</h2>
        <h5>Please slow down and read this.</h5>
        <p>edureka is a proven path to your first software developer job.</p>

        <p>
          More than 40,000 people have gotten developer jobs after completing
          this – including at big companies like Google and Microsoft.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning
          and earn these certifications in order.
        </p>

        <p>
          To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all
          their tests to pass.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can add these certifications to your résumé or LinkedIn. But more
          important than the certifications is the practice you get along the
          way.
        </p>

        <p>If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.</p>

        <p>Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.</p>

        <p>
          And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on
          programming practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we
          also have thousands of hours of video courses on edureka's YouTube
          channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to get a developer job or freelance clients, programming
          skills will be just part of the puzzle. You also need to build your
          personal network and your reputation as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can do this on Twitter and GitHub, and also on the edureka forum.
        </p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
